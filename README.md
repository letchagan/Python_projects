# Simple Calculator Using Tkinter

## Project Description
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) based calculator built using the Tkinter library in Python. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project demonstrates the use of Tkinter for creating simple and user-friendly GUI applications.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: Clear the current input to start a new calculation.
- **Responsive Layout**: Buttons are aligned properly and resize with the window, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message for invalid input, such as division by zero or malformed expressions.

## Components
1. **Entry Widget**: Displays the current input and result. Allows users to enter numbers and arithmetic expressions.
2. **Buttons**: 
   - Digits (0-9) for numerical input.
   - Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for arithmetic operations.
   - `.` for decimal point input.
   - `=` to evaluate the expression.
   - `C` to clear the input.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script to open the calculator window.
2. **Enter Numbers and Operations**: Click the buttons or use the keyboard to enter numbers and select operations.
3. **Evaluate**: Click the `=` button to compute the result.
4. **Clear**: Use the `C` button to clear the current input and start a new calculation.

## Requirements
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with most Python installations. If not, you can install it using `pip install tk`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
